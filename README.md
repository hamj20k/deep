# deep


welcome to **deep**, a personal collection of deep learning assignments and projects—some from courses, some from my own time. this is mostly a **reference point** for concepts, implementations, and experiments i’ve worked on. nothing fancy, just a place to keep track of things.  

---

## what's inside  

this repo is split into two main sections:  

### coursework assignments  
structured assignments covering essential deep learning topics, including:  

- **neural networks** – backpropagation, optimization strategies, activation functions  
- **convolutional networks** – image classification, feature extraction, transfer learning  
- **sequence models** – rnns, transformers, attention mechanisms, nlp applications  
- **generative models** – vaes, gans, diffusion models  

### independent projects  
things i’ve built, tested, or experimented with in my own time:  

- **custom architectures** – messing with novel network structures, tweaking hyperparameters  
- **reinforcement learning** – applying deep rl to interesting problems  
- **applied ai** – using deep learning in ways that actually do something  

---

## tech stack  

- **frameworks** – pytorch, tensorflow, jax  
- **libraries** – numpy, opencv, hugging face, scikit-learn  
- **notebooks** – jupyter, google colab  
- **hardware** – runs on cpu/gpu setups, tested on local machines  

---

## why this repo exists  

this isn’t some polished showcase—it's just a space for me to **keep track of implementations, revisit key ideas, and iterate on things i find interesting**. if someone else finds it useful, cool. if not, that’s fine too.  

---

## how to navigate  

each directory is self-contained with a short readme for context. code is mostly documented, but don’t expect perfection.  

---

## future additions  

this repo changes as i go deeper into new techniques, architectures, and research papers. some planned additions:  

- **meta-learning & few-shot learning**  
- **self-supervised learning**  
- **more rl applications**  

---

## final note  

this is mostly for me. if you find something useful, great! if you have questions, ask. if it breaks, fix it.
